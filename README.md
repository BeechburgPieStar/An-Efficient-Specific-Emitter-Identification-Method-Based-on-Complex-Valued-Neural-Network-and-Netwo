# Radio-Frequency-Fingerprinting: An-Efficient-Specific-Emitter-Identification-Method-Based-on-Complex-Valued-Neural-Network-and-Network-Compression

Requirements: keras=2.1.4, tf=1.14.0

SGD: Sparse structure selection based on the simple SGD

PSGD: Sparse structure selectionbased on ISTA 

FastPSGD: Sparse structure selection based on FISTA, its convergence speed is faster than that of PSGD

future works: AMP+ADMM for sparse structure selection
